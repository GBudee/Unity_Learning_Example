### About Game Development
- Motivating way to become a good craftsperson
- For programming, take math all the way to linear algebra; take CS all the way to computer graphics; at home, make 2d games in Unity
- For art, take classes where you learn color and light theory; at home, do digital drawing

### Using Github:
- Use Github Desktop to "clone" a project to your own computer
- Create a "Unity-style" .gitignore file when creating a new project
- To use: make and save changes, then "push" them to the cloud
- "Discard" to undo changes that turned out bad

### Lesson Plan:
- Installing useful packages with the Unity Asset Store
  - Probuilder
  - DOTween
- Creating scripts and adding them to primitives
-
